/*
 Find the length of the longest substring T of a given string (consists of lowercase letters only) such that every character in T appears no less than k times.
 
 Example 1:
 
 Input:
 s = "aaabb", k = 3
 
 Output:
 3
 
 The longest substring is "aaa", as 'a' is repeated 3 times.
 Example 2:
 
 Input:
 s = "ababbc", k = 2
 
 Output:
 5
 
 The longest substring is "ababb", as 'a' is repeated 2 times and 'b' is repeated 3 times.
