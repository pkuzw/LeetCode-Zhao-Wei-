/*
 Given two strings s and t which consist of only lowercase letters.
 
 String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.
 
 Find the letter that was added in t.
 
 Example:
 
 Input:
 s = "abcd"
 t = "abcde"
 
 Output:
 e
 
 Explanation:
 'e' is the letter that was added.
