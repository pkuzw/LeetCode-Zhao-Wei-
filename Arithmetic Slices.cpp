     1. iteration
     2. enumerate all the elements in the array, find all the arithmetic slices and store their length. 
     3. for the length = n, the arithmetic slices' number is equal to (n - 1)(n - 2) / 2
     4. if a slice isn't arithmetic, the next slice should be judged at the last one of the previous slice, not the neighbor of the last element of previous slice. For example, {1,2,3,4,5,5,5}, the first slice is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} and the second slice is {5, 5, 5}, not {5, 5}.

/*
 A sequence of number is called arithmetic if it consists of at least three elements and if the difference between any two consecutive elements is the same.
 
 For example, these are arithmetic sequence:
 
 1, 3, 5, 7, 9
 7, 7, 7, 7
 3, -1, -5, -9
 The following sequence is not arithmetic.
 
 1, 1, 2, 5, 7
 
 A zero-indexed array A consisting of N numbers is given. A slice of that array is any pair of integers (P, Q) such that 0 <= P < Q < N.
 
 A slice (P, Q) of array A is called arithmetic if the sequence:
 A[P], A[p + 1], ..., A[Q - 1], A[Q] is arithmetic. In particular, this means that P + 1 < Q.
 
 The function should return the number of arithmetic slices in the array A.
 
 
 Example:
 
 A = [1, 2, 3, 4]
 
 return: 3, for 3 arithmetic slices in A: [1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 4] and [1, 2, 3, 4] itself.
